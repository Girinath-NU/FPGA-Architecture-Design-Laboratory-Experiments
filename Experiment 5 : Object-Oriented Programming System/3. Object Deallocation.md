# 3. Object Deallocation

- Object deallocation is managed automatically by the simulator.

- When no handle references an object, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

- Users release objects by assigning handles to `null`.

```systemverilog
class Packet2;
  int id;              // packet identifier
endclass

 module tb_dealloc;
   Packet2 p;           
   initial begin
     p = new ();         
     p = null;          
   $finish;

  end
 endmodule
 ```
