- Composition represents a has-a relationship between classes.

- One class contains an object of another class as a member.

- It is used to build complex systems from simpler components.

```systemverilog
  class Engine;
    function void start();
      $display("Engine start"); // engine behavior
    endfunction
  endclass

  class Car;
  Engine e;               // has-a relationship
    function new();
      e = new();         // create engine object  
    endfunction
  endclass

  module tb_composition;
    Car c;                  // Car object
    initial begin
      c = new();
      c.e.start();          // Access composed object
    end
  endmodule
```
```
OUTPUT : Engine start
```
- Because the `Car` constructor creates an `Engine` object, and calling `c.e.start()` invokes the engine method.
