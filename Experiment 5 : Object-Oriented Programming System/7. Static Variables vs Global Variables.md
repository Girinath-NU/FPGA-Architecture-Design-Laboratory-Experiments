# Static Class Variables

- Static variables belong to the class, not to individual objects.

- They are shared among all instances of the class.

- Commonly used for counters and shared resources.

```systemverilog
  class C;
    static int total;   // shared across all objects
    int id;             // instance-specific variable
    function new();
      total++;          
      id = total;       
    endfunction
  endclass

  module tb_static;
    C c1, c2;     // multiple objects       
   initial begin
     c1 = new();
     c2 = new();
   end
endmodule
```
##

# Global Variables (Package Scope)

- Package variables act as global variables.

- They are shared by all modules and classes that import the package.

- Their lifetime spans the entire simulation.

```systemverilog
 package globals_pkg;
   int g_count;       // global variable  
 endpackage

 module tb_global;
   import globals_pkg::*;
   initial begin
     g_count = 10;      // access global variable
   end
  endmodule
```
